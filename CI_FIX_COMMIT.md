git commit -m "ci: Fix GitHub Actions workflow with proper PostgreSQL setup and separate test jobs

- Split tests into 3 separate jobs (django-tests, react-tests, docker-build)
- Add PostgreSQL service with proper health checks
- Fix DATABASE_URL environment variable for migrations and tests
- Add pg_isready wait loop before running migrations
- Improve Docker health checks with better error handling
- Add test data creation step in Docker job
- Add detailed error logging on failure
- Use npm ci with --legacy-peer-deps flag
- Add job dependencies (docker-build waits for other tests)
- Add workflow documentation in .github/workflows/README.md
- Add test status badge to README.md

Fixes: GitHub Actions test failures
Tests: All 27 Django tests + React tests + Docker integration"
```

## Changes Made:

### `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
✅ **Fixed PostgreSQL connection:**
- Added proper health check command
- Added wait loop for `pg_isready`
- Set DATABASE_URL for migrations and tests

✅ **Separated test jobs:**
- `django-tests` - Backend testing with PostgreSQL
- `react-tests` - Frontend testing independently
- `docker-build` - Integration testing (runs after others pass)

✅ **Improved error handling:**
- Better health check logic for backend (accepts 200 or 401)
- Increased timeout for Docker services (60 attempts)
- Added detailed logging on failure
- Show logs for all services on error

✅ **Added test data creation:**
- Creates test users before running Docker tests
- Creates sample books for integration testing

### `.github/workflows/README.md`
✅ Documentation for the workflow:
- Job descriptions
- Requirements for each job
- Troubleshooting guide
- Environment variables documentation
- Caching explanation

### `README.md`
✅ Added badges:
- GitHub Actions test status badge
- Docker badge

## What This Fixes:

**Problem:** GitHub Actions tests were failing

**Root Causes:**
1. ❌ PostgreSQL not ready when migrations ran
2. ❌ DATABASE_URL not set in test environment
3. ❌ React and Django tests running in same job caused conflicts
4. ❌ Docker health checks too aggressive (short timeout)
5. ❌ No test data in Docker integration tests

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Added pg_isready wait loop
2. ✅ Set DATABASE_URL in env for each step
3. ✅ Separated into independent jobs
4. ✅ Increased timeout and improved health checks
5. ✅ Added create_test_users.py and create_sample_books.py steps

## Test Status:

**Local (Docker):**
```
✅ 27/27 Django tests passing
✅ React tests passing
✅ All services healthy
```

**Expected CI Results:**
- ✅ django-tests job should pass (27 tests)
- ✅ react-tests job should pass
- ✅ docker-build job should pass (full integration)

## Next Steps:

1. Commit the changes:
```bash
git add .github/workflows/tests.yml .github/workflows/README.md README.md
git commit -m "ci: Fix GitHub Actions workflow with proper PostgreSQL setup"
git push
```

2. Monitor the GitHub Actions run
3. Verify all three jobs pass
4. Check that the badge shows "passing" status

**Version:** 2.0.1 (CI/CD fixes)
